I am a computational biologist with broad experience leveraging [mathematical modeling](https://elifesciences.org/articles/84878), [Bayesian statistical inference](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1907869116), and [scientific software engineering](https://cremerlab.github.io/hplc-py) to decode the complex mechanisms governing cellular function and behavior. I am passionate about building performant and robust software that employs quantitative methods to dissect biological data, and building strong collaborations with scientists and engineers across disciplines.
